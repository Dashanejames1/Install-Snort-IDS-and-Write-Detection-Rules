## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Nmap** — Used for both standard scanning and running NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts to detect and, in one case, actively exploit vulnerabilities
- **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)** — Ran default (`-sC`), targeted (`ftp-anon`, `smb-vuln*`), and broad (`vuln`) script categories against the target
- **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)** — Referenced to research CVE details, CVSS scores, and attack vectors for confirmed vulnerabilities

Port / Service / Vulnerability / NSE Script / Severity / Notes

21/tcp (FTP) - ftp-vsftpd-backdoor (CVE-2011-2523)	🔴 Critical	Live exploitation confirmed. The vulnerable vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor allowed remote command execution and root shell access. (CVSS 9.8)

22/tcp (SSH) - Weak SSH cryptographic configuration - 🟡 Medium	Weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms were identified, potentially reducing the security of encrypted communications.

23/tcp (Telnet) - Telnet service detected	🟠 High	Telnet transmits credentials in plaintext, making usernames and passwords susceptible to interception.

80/tcp (HTTP) - Slowloris Denial-of-Service	🟡 Medium	The web server appears susceptible to the Slowloris DoS attack, which can exhaust server connections and deny service to legitimate users.

80/tcp (HTTP) - HTTP TRACE method enabled	🟢 Low	TRACE is enabled, which may aid reconnaissance or cross-site tracing attacks but does not directly compromise the server.

80/tcp (HTTP) - SQL Injection vulnerability	🟠 High	SQL injection was detected and could allow attackers to retrieve, modify, or delete database information.

111/tcp (rpcbind) - RPC information disclosure	🟢 Low	rpcbind exposes information about available RPC services, assisting attacker reconnaissance.

139/tcp (NetBIOS/SMB) - SMB enumeration	🟡 Medium	SMB information disclosure allows attackers to gather host and share information useful for later attacks.

445/tcp (SMB) - smb-vuln-ms10-061 🟢 Not Vulnerable	NSE script returned false, indicating the system is not vulnerable to MS10-061.

445/tcp (SMB) - smb-vuln-ms10-054 🟢 Not Vulnerable	NSE script returned false, indicating the target is not affected by MS10-054.

445/tcp (SMB) - smb-vuln-regsvc-dos	⚪ Inconclusive	The script failed to complete successfully, so the vulnerability status could not be determined.

3306/tcp (MySQL) - MySQL information disclosure	🟡 Medium	Database version and service information were exposed, which may help attackers identify known exploits.

443/tcp (HTTPS) - Logjam (Weak Diffie-Hellman Parameters) 🟡 Medium	Weak Diffie-Hellman parameters reduce TLS security and could allow encrypted communications to be weakened under certain attack scenarios

**Findings:** 

The table above consolidates all of the findings reported during the Nmap --script vuln scan and categorizes each result by severity. The most significant finding was the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) on port 21, which was successfully exploited to obtain root-level access, making it the only Critical vulnerability confirmed through live exploitation. Several additional weaknesses were identified, including SQL injection, Telnet running without encryption, Slowloris denial-of-service susceptibility, and weak SSH cryptographic settings, all of which increase the attack surface of the target system. The SMB vulnerability checks also demonstrated that vulnerability scans can produce different outcomes: some scripts confirmed the system was not vulnerable, while others returned inconclusive results because the checks could not be completed. Overall, the scan illustrates the importance of reviewing every NSE script result individually, as findings may represent confirmed vulnerabilities, informational issues, successful mitigations, or inconclusive tests requiring additional investigation.

## 🛡️ Defensive Recommendations

Based on findings, the following remediations would be recommended in a real environment:

1. **vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor (Critical)** — Immediately upgrade or replace the FTP service; this version is known to contain an intentional backdoor and should never be used in production.
2. **Anonymous FTP login allowed** — Disable anonymous access entirely; require authenticated accounts for any FTP access.
3. **Telnet enabled (plaintext credentials)** — Disable Telnet and replace with SSH for all remote administration.
4. **SMB message signing disabled** — Enable SMB message signing to prevent tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks on SMB traffic.
5. **SQL injection on port 80** — Implement input validation/parameterized queries on the web application, and consider a WAF as an additional layer of defense.

## 📚 CySA+ Exam Relevance

This lab directly maps to the following CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-003) exam domains:

| Domain | Coverage |

| Security Operations (33%) | Hands-on use of Nmap and NSE scripts to perform reconnaissance and identify live services and misconfigurations |
| Vulnerability Management (30%) | Running vulnerability-check scripts (`smb-vuln*`, `vuln`), interpreting results, and cross-referencing CVE/CVSS data from NVD |
| Incident Response (20%) | Recognizing confirmed exploitation (root access via vsFTPd backdoor) as evidence of active compromise |
| Reporting & Communication (17%) | Documenting findings by severity in a structured, readable format for technical and non-technical audiences |

## 🔑 Technical Notes

> # Note: not all NSE vulnerability scripts behave the same way — most only detect and report (true/false), while a small number (like ftp-vsftpd-backdoor) actually attempt live exploitation. Always check script documentation or output carefully rather than assuming uniform behavior.
>
> "Always add the -n flag to Nmap scans in this VMware environment to prevent DNS resolution hangs."]
> 
> -sP and -sT contradict eachother (Can't be used together because -sP means just do a ping/host-discovery sweep, skip ports entirely but -sT tells Nmap to do a full TCP connect port scan. These commands contradict eachother.)

```bash

# Any important commands or workarounds
[-sC]
[-Pn]

# Any important commands or workarounds

# Task 1: Run default scripts (-sC) against key ports
sudo nmap -sC -Pn --disable-arp-ping -n -p 21,22,80,445 192.168.79.130

# Task 2: Check FTP for anonymous login specifically
sudo nmap --script ftp-anon -Pn --disable-arp-ping -n -p 21 192.168.79.130

# Task 3: Run all SMB vulnerability scripts against port 445
sudo nmap --script smb-vuln* -Pn --disable-arp-ping -n -p 445 192.168.79.130

# Task 4: Run the full vuln script category across all open ports
sudo nmap --script vuln -Pn --disable-arp-ping -n 192.168.79.130

# Workaround: -p requires a value directly after it — omitting the port number
# (e.g. "-p 192.168.79.130") causes Nmap to misinterpret the target IP as a
# port specification. To scan all ports instead of a specific one, remove
# the -p flag entirely rather than leaving it empty.

# Workaround: always use -n in this lab to prevent DNS resolution hangs,
# since the isolated Host-Only network has no real DNS server.

# Note: --script <name>* (wildcard) runs every NSE script matching that
# name pattern — useful for running a whole category (e.g. smb-vuln*)
# in a single command instead of specifying each script individually.
```

## 📌 About This Project

[1-2 sentences about how this fits into your overall portfolio and career goals.]

This repository is part of my broader cybersecurity portfolio demonstrating practical, hands-on vulnerability assessment skills from initial scanning through confirmed exploitation as I work toward a career as a cybersecurity analyst.

This repository is important because here we have built up to the point of having live proof of the actual exploitation by an automated Nmap script for the CVE-2011-2523. In a past NVD task I researched this exact vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 now this has come full circle and we found out how this exact vulnerability is exploited and root access was acheived.
